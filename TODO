A lot of builder functions on the `JointBuilder`

Maybe add flip axes function to builder

- [ ] Add Mirroring delimiter to GroupID
- [ ] Add Incrementable delimiter to GroupID

- [ ] Update CI-PYTHON to build for multiple python versions

https://github.com/python/mypy for stub testing and generation?
Or https://monkeytype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


-----

joint_state_publisher requires both upper and lower limit for all now continous or fixed types

FOR PYTHON DOCS: https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/

Transmission Rewrite, due to not documentation of URDF being incorrect https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/blob/noetic-devel/transmission_interface/src/simple_transmission_loader.cpp#L42

Maybe add BaseJointBuilder -> Current joint builder -> GenericJointBuilder
and add serveral smart ones

FIX MIRRORING for non easy cases

- [ ] When PyLink attaches something it should update the dicts on the python object.
- [ ] Can still see ._internal when importing
- [ ] Create roadmap.md
- [x] Upgrade VisBuilder to ColBuilder and back
    - [ ] Make helper functions take VisualBuilder
    - [ ] Optional: Add VisCol fn to link
